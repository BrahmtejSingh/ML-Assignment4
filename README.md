## K-Means Clustering Assignment
# Overview
This assignment involves implementing the K-means algorithm and applying it to two main tasks: understanding its mechanism through a sample dataset and image compression. The goal is to familiarize students with the fundamentals of clustering algorithms, specifically K-means, and to see how it can be applied in practical scenarios like reducing the number of colors in an image.

# Contents
1. Introduction to K-means Clustering: An initial exploration of the K-means algorithm, including the steps involved in the algorithm.
2. Implementing K-means
    Finding closest centroids
    Computing centroid means
3. K-means on a Sample Dataset: Applying the K-means algorithm to a small, simple dataset to understand its workings in a controlled environment.
4. Random Initialization: A discussion and implementation of random initialization and its importance in the K-means algorithm.
5. Image Compression with K-means.\
   5.1 Working with a dataset.\
    5.2 Applying K-means on image pixels.\
    5.3 Compressing the image by reducing the number of colors
